# predictionEngine
### A fairly simple prediction engine designed to recommend movies according to a questionnaire we did in the class.

This assignment includes:
 * In the terminal, get a mirror from the assignment repository in GitHub (We're still learning how to use GitHub and all this software engineering thing by that time).
 * Track progress with Git
 * Make repository commit in terminal
 * Understand the source code and write a complete Makefile
 * Write "generate_all_predictions.bash" that generates predictions for all users looping over all files in the data directory and treating them one by one as the "target". 
 * The product should be something like: **Top movie pick for user Shayan Sheikh is: Brooklyn**.
